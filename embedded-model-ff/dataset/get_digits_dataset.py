The Digit Dataset
=========================================================

This dataset is made up of 1797 8x8 images. Each image,
like the one shown below, is of a hand-written digit.
In order to utilize an 8x8 figure like this, we'd have to
first transform it into a feature vector with length 64.

See `here
<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pen-Based+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits>`_
for more information about this dataset.
